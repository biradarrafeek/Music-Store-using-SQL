## Project Overview:
**✓** Designed and implemented a robust database structure to support a music related business intelligence system. The project involved structuring data to 
enable effective analysis of customer behaviours, top-selling artists, and 
revenue trends across regions.
## Project Steps:
**✓ Database Structure Planning:** Defined the schema with key entities like 
Customer, Invoice, Artist, Genre, and Track, ensuring each table accurately 
captured relationships and transactional data.

**✓ Schema Design & Normalization:** Applied normalization principles to 
eliminate redundancy and maintain data integrity, resulting in efficient data 
storage and retrieval.

**✓ Key Relationships & Indexing:** Established primary and foreign keys to define 
clear relationships (e.g., linking customers to invoices, artists to tracks). 
Added indexing on frequently queried columns for performance 
enhancement.

**✓ Query Optimization & Testing:** Designed complex SQL queries for in-depth 
analysis, such as top customers by country, revenue by city, and most popular 
genres. Employed CTEs, window functions, and subqueries to maximize 
efficiency.

**✓ Validation & Documentation:** Verified accuracy through testing and 
documented the schema, query processes, and insights for future scalability
